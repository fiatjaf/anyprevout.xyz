<h1>SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT</h1>

<p>
  <code>SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT</code>, or
  <a href="https://bips.xyz/118"
    >BIP-118</a
  >
  (previously named <code>SIGHASH_NOINPUT</code>), is a soft-fork that allows a
  transaction to be signed without reference to any specific previous output,
  such that later any output with a matching signature can be dynamically
  added later.
</p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>
  There are two main super-powerful things you can do with BIP-118 that you
  cannot do otherwise:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Eltoo</b>, a protocol that fulfills
    <a
      href="https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg07882.html"
      >Satoshi's vision for <code>nSequence</code></a
    >
    by allowing peers to exchange presigned transactions offchain with increased
    sequence numbers such that only the latest one can be published to the
    chain. Read
    <a href="https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf">the whitepaper</a> or this
    <a href="https://fiatjaf.alhur.es/ffdfe772.html"
      >more approachable explanation</a
    >, or listen to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-sighash-anyprevout-and-eltoo-could-improve-the-lightning-network">this podcast episode that explains it</a>.
    <br />

    With Eltoo we can do:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZjymCOmn_A"
          >Improved Lightning Channels</a
        >, which allow for:
        <ul>
          <li>Lightweight and almost free watchtowers.</li>
          <li>Safer channel management without penalty transactions.</li>
          <li>
            Ability to close a channel entirely to one side, without toxic change
            being left at the other side.
          </li>
          <li>Much easier channel backups.</li>
          <li>

              >Multiparty channels</a
            >
            (also known as "channel factories").
          </li>
          <li>
            Less fee estimation problems that cause fee overpayments and
            unwanted channel closes.
          </li>
          <li>Interoperability with currently existing Lightning channels.</li>
          <li>
            The
            <a href="https://global-mesh-labs.gitbook.io/lot49/">Lot49</a>
            protocol for Lightning-powered low-latency mesh networks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a
              href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-January/002448.html"
              >Layered commitments</a
            >
            that further simplify channels.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overall much simpler protocol flow that allows for easier
            implementation of other ideas on top of Lightning.
          </li>
        </ul>

          >Blind Statechains</a
        >, a protocol for off-chain transfer of UTXOs using blind servers and/or
        federations as semi-trusted third-parties.

        <br />
        Statechains can be used:
        <ul>
          <li>
            As an offchain value transfer mechanism in itself, used to transfer
            large values as single, unbroken UTXOs (with change being given with
            statechains of smaller denominations or through other means).
          </li>
          <li>
            To open Lightning channels on top of these UTXOs. And then these
            channels can be transferred to others without the chain being touched.
          </li>
          <li>
            To implement some variation of the
            <a href="https://zmnscpxj.github.io/bitcoin/unchained.html"
              >Smart Contracts Unchained</a
            >
            idea.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Covenants</b>, a way to make sure <b>one transaction can only be spent by an
    specific other</b> can be
    achieved using
    <a
      href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-June/017036.html"
      >this secret little trick</a
    >
    that embeds the signature for transaction <code>t+1</code> right inside the
    output of transaction <code>t</code>.

    <br />

    These covenants enable very important things such as:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ow4Q34Jeg">Spacechains</a>,
        blindly merge-mined blockchains that enhance the Bitcoin ecosystem because
        despite them not having a 2-way peg mechanism, they also don't have a speculative
        altcoin in them.

        Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2ow4Q34Jeg">the presentation</a>, read <a href="https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/5e4be6d18e5fa526b17d8b34906b16a5">the brief BMM explanation</a> or <a href="https://t.me/spacechains">join the Telegram group</a>.

        <br />

        With Spacechains we can do

        <ul>
          <li>A chain for all kinds of assets issued by entities or individuals;</li>
          <li>A DNS chain that solves Zooko's triangle without needing an altcoin;</li>
          <li>A chain that executes Ethereum-like smart-contracts;</li>
          <li>A chain with BTC IOU tokens in it, guaranteed by an entity, by hashrate escrows, some magical zero-knowledge proof system or some other complex mechanism yet to be invented;</li>
          <li>A chain with all of the above;</li>
        </ul>

        All without burdening Bitcoin users and at the same time paying fees to miners who don't even have to be aware these things exist.
      </li>
      <li>
        Safer

          >all use cases enabled by
          <code>OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY</code></a
        >
        (although in most of these examples <code>OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY</code> is
        more space-efficient, there are other tradeoffs that weight on both sides).

<h2>Steps to Activation</h2>

<ol>

    >.
  </li>
  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" /> Have the benefits and tradeoffs of the change
    explained in clear form and acknowledged by anyone who may be interested
    (this website is an attempt at this).
  </li>
  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" /> Get working
    <a

      >(?)</a
    >
    code for it.
  </li>
  <li><input type="checkbox" /> Make a testnet for it.</li>
  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" /> (Who knows what has to happen for something to be
    soft-forked in, but let's hope at this point
    <a href="https://taprootactivation.com/"
      >miners will push for it themselves</a
    >
    so it won't take 2 years.)
